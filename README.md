# Introduction
KiraOS is a self-made Operating System mainly written in C++ for fun and study. It is designed to run on x86 machine with easiest instruction involved. Anyone is welcomed to give suggestion or create PR or issue, I really want to do something interesting and helpful.

# Reference
There are quite a lot guidance to show how to design and implenment a simple operating system, I would refer to the following books or websites:
